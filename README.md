This is version 1.03 of my SleepIQ Lowenstein data file uplaoder via the API.  
  
To use this script:  
 -- recommended to use a virtual python environment (e.g. python -m venv sleepiq-api).  
 -- Install the required python modules:  pip install requests python-dotenv  
 -- Copy the uploader file to your desired location.  
 -- Upon first run of the script, it will walk you through asking for the required information and creating. 
    a .env file in the same location as the script.
